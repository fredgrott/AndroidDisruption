# Introduction

Play and Innovation comes about when you have mastred some skills in
such a way as to be able to use them as a set of Legos to construct 
new processes and ideas.  Doing the work will get you to the play 
and create parts of this new and exciting world of android. And trust 
me, there are play parts in this android development course.

## Preparation

Some of you come from a non-programming and non-computer science realm 
of human pursuits. Some of you come from a non-science background or 
come from a background where you might not have a college degree.

I will not tell you that you absolutely need to pick up the subjects of
mathemathics, philosopy, critical thinking, science, etc. However, 
just as the game monopoly teaches and re-teaches insuhc diverse subjects as
finite math, micro-economics,etc you wil find the play with this course 
teaching or re-teching in these diverse subjects and of couse whenever 
mentioned there will be set of footnotes to lookup and read at the end 
of each chapter.

At the least to prepare to get the most from this course is to 
set about some blocks of time to work on the exercises and of course 
one high performance laptop with some internet access.
