# Introduction

Play and Innovation comes about when you have mastred some skills in
such a way as to be able to use them as a set of Legos to construct 
new processes and ideas.  Doing the work will get you to the play 
and create parts of this new and exciting world of android. And trust 
me, there are play parts in this android development course.

## Preparation

Some of you come from a non-programming and non-computer science realm 
of human pursuits. Some of you come from a non-science background or 
come from a background where you might not have a college degree.

I will not tell you that you absolutely need to pick up the subjects of
mathemathics, philosopy, critical thinking, science, etc. However, 
just as the game monopoly teaches and re-teaches in such diverse subjects as
finite math, micro-economics,etc you wil find the play with this course 
teaching or re-teching in these diverse subjects and of couse whenever 
mentioned there will be set of footnotes to lookup and read at the end 
of each chapter.

At the least to prepare to get the most from this course is to 
set about some blocks of time to work on the exercises and of course 
one high performance laptop with some internet access.

## Approach

Alan Kay has stated:
 
 I had the fortune or misfortune to learn how to read fluently starting at 
 the age of three. So I had read maybe 150 books by the time I hit 1st grade. 
 And I already knew that the teachers were lying to me.
 
A large portion of developers and others has put up this wall of elite 
BS that this not approachable to the common person and in fact they are 
lying to you when they do that.

I in this non-elite approach borrow from some eductional theories, such as
constructiionism. In this approach we move you to the task of being able to
construct mind models of the learning materials and than move you towards 
activites that allow you to play with those models in the spirit of Lego blocks 
and in the spirit of the Logo Turtle.

One of aspect of my android centric approach is that I am going to 
ask that you install and use Linux either through  a VM such as VMWarePlayer(Workstation), or through installing 
Linux under the MS Windows UEFI. This goes back to the that 
mind model that I want you to construct and play with in that 
Android OS is based on some Unix concepts that will benefit in you in this
play adventure I am asking to embark on.

I also borrow from the hacker philosophies that got its start at 
MIT in that:
     -You break it , you fix
     -Information is and should be free to empower humankind

Next, 

[Thanks]
