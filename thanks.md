Thanks to the ones that went before me:

Zed Shaw, thank you for re-awakening the core reasons why 
I started programming in the first place.,,to play and 
explore.

Alan Kay, the first step in critical thinking is having 
no idols and the second step is empowering others. Thank you 
Alan Kay for re-awakening both computer science and 
education theory within the United States.

Jean Piaget, you passed well before the world understood the 
gift that you had wrestled from depths of non-knowledge. We still have 
not in our practice of your work on education theory begun to give 
the full amount of respect you so deeply deserve.

Seymour Papert, thank you for the LISP dialect and the play tool 
called Logo. Logo opened my eyes in highchool to learning in a different 
way.
